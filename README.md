# sentiment-analysis

With the enormous increase in web technologies, number of people expressing their views and opinions via web are increasing. This information is very useful for businesses, governments and individuals. Users often discuss on current affairs and share their personal opinion on various subjects via “tweets”. In this project we use this information as our data source and using machine learning techniques and natural language processing we can extract the subjective information of a document and try to classify it according to its polarity such as positive, neutral or negative. This analysis can help companies find out what people think about their services/products or how well their product is performing in the market. Political parties may be interested to know how many people support a particular political decision or a certain political event.

Keywords: Twitter, tweets, public opinion, sentiment analysis, language processing, analysis, sentiment polarity.
